Using Git!

- Make sure Git is downloaded. https://git-scm.com/downloads
If you need to know whether system is 32- or 64- bit, type "uname -m" in bash

- Open terminal in directory. 

- Initialize git: "git init"

- Try "git status" to figure out which files git knows exist

- Now, add file to staging environment by running
"git add [filename]"

- Try "git status" again to see what's changed!

- Commit the file: sudo git commit -m "[useful comments describing what's changed]"

- Now that that's done. Go to github, create your account, and create a repo.

- If you want to create a new branch, run
"git checkout -b [branch name]" Then do git branch to see the hierarchy

- In Github, while you created the repo, copy the HTTPS link. 
Back to terminal. Run "git remote add origin [HTTPS link to repo]"

- "git push -u origin master" to push to the repo. Or replace "master" by the name of the branch you created and want to add to the repo.
You will have to put your github username and password (it may be the token, which is super duper long)

- Boom, done! Visit github to admire your new repo with a file in it. 

- Say you made some changes to the file, and want to add a new version: add it to staging environment, add a new commit, and push changes.
